# Lossless NFTs

Ethereum dApp allowing for nft-based experiments in mechanism design.

Project built with scaffold eth.

Only part of the intended functionality is available so far, but
## Try it out on [Rinkeby](https://lossless-nfts.surge.sh/) 🤩


## Concept: Create and manage NFTs with up-only price

Special ERC721 contract that twists the usual meaning of NFT ownership. Extra incentives are added such that the price can only ever increase.
### Actors
- Author
- Minter
- Grabber

#### **Author** creates NFT.
Sets
- minimum price
- author fee (% or fixed)

=> NFT becomes visible in app gallery. Can be minted by anyone.

#### **Minter** mints NFT.
Sets
- price (>= minimum price)
- premium (% value)

#### **Grabber** takes NFT permissionlessly
- Anyone can grab an NFT
- Grabbing requires to pay the **grabPrice** = price + premium
- Grabber becomes the new owner
- grabPrice increases by the premium that was just paid (**price premium compounds** across grabs)


### Locking mechanism

An owner can **lock**/**unlock** the asset. Only the owner can do this.

Unlocking disables all the grab-related functionality. Then the asset becomes **a regular NFT**. 

Locking is associated with a fee (the author fee). Everytime an asset is locked the author gets paid that fee.

If the author fee is set as %, it's always calculated relative to the current grabPrice of the asset.

## WIP (not done yet)

- as a user I can author an asset
  - upload to IPFS
  - specify metadata
  - set minPrice and author fee 

- as a user I can see all assets from a given author
  - organize the gallery page based on a specific author
  - these pages should be shareable/bookmarkable
  - needs backend support (probably firebase storage for an MVP)

- lock / unlock feature

# 🏗 Scaffold-ETH

> everything you need to build on Ethereum! 🚀

🧪 Quickly experiment with Solidity using a frontend that adapts to your smart contract:

# 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start

Prerequisites: [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> clone/fork 🏗 scaffold-eth:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth.git
```

> install and start your 👷‍ Hardhat chain:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn install
yarn chain
```

> in a second terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn start
```

> in a third terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn deploy
```

🔏 Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`

📝 Edit your frontend `App.jsx` in `packages/react-app/src`

💼 Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`
